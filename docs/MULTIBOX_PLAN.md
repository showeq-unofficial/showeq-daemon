# Multibox Sessions

Status: feat/multibox-sessions, in progress.

## Goal

A single daemon instance captures and decodes every EQ client session
visible on the wire. Web clients select which session ("box") is the
active decode target; switching is live.

v1 scope: **capture + multi-decode, single-active**. The daemon owns N
per-session decode pipelines but only emits the active one to web. v2
opens the door to parallel-active (one tab per box).

## Today's coupling

- `EQPacket` single-shot latches `m_client_addr` on the first
  world-port packet (`packet.cpp:627`). After that, the BPF filter and
  stream dispatch (`packet.cpp:681-700`) ignore other clients on the
  wire.
- One quad of `EQPacketStream`s (world C↔S, zone C↔S) per daemon.
- One instance of each state manager: `SpawnShell`, `Player`,
  `ZoneMgr`, `MessageShell`, `SpellShell`, `GroupMgr`, `CombatRouter`,
  `SpawnMonitor`. Wired by `daemonapp.cpp:181-256`.
- Workaround in CLAUDE.md:12: run N daemons, one `--ip` each.
- Prior fragment-layer multibox fix (`8687904`, `400310d`) broke
  single-client decoding; reverted. Lesson: fix at session-pinning
  layer, not in `PacketFragment::addFragment`.

## Becomes per-session ("Box")

- `EQPacketStream`s (×4)
- `SpawnShell`, `Player`, `ZoneMgr`
- `MessageShell`, `SpellShell`, `GroupMgr`, `CombatRouter`
- `SpawnMonitor` (per-zone state is per-box)

## Stays daemon-global

- `ItemCache` (cross-box, file-backed)
- `GuildMgr` (cross-server but server-uniform)
- `FilterMgr` (user-defined filters apply to whichever box is active)
- `Spells`, `EQStrings`, `Messages`/`MessageFilters`,
  `CategoryMgr`, `PrefsBroker`, `DateTimeMgr`, `DataLocationMgr`

## Box identity — two-layer

L4 headers and decoded state arrive at different times, so identity is
layered.

**Wire-routing key (immediate, L4 only):**
`(client_ip, client_world_port, server_world_port)`. This is all
`EQPacket::dispatchPacket` has on the first world packet — used to
route bytes to the right Box before any decode has happened.

**Steady-state wire key:** once a Box exists, EQ rolls its UDP socket
on each zone change. Track `(client_ip, latest_port_pair)` and update
when a new pair binds to a known box's client_ip and no other box
claims it.

**Stable identity (post-handshake):** `player_id` (the local PC's
spawn id, surfaced by `Player::id()` once `OP_PlayerProfile` fires).
This is the value the UI shows users — "Soandso (192.168.1.42)" not
"192.168.1.42:17234". `player_id` is stable across zone hops, ip
changes, and port rolls. **Promotion**: when OP_PlayerProfile arrives
on a Box with an unset `player_id`, the daemon sets it; if a Box with
that `player_id` already exists (relog → new 5-tuple), merge.

**External `box_id`** (the value used in proto `SetActiveBox`):
`player_id` when known, else a placeholder derived from the
creation-time 5-tuple. Once promoted, the placeholder is alias-mapped
to the real id so in-flight UI references don't break.

**v1 hole:** two same-host boxes zoning simultaneously can lose the
port-pair → box mapping until the next packet identifies them.
Acceptable; recovers within seconds.

## Naming

Proto already uses `session_id` as a *reconnect resume token*
(`Snapshot.session_id`, `Subscribe.session_id`). New concept is a
**Box**: `box_id` on the wire. Internal C++ class: `Box`.

## Stages

Each stage ships behind a stable daemon binary; goldens must still
pass between stages.

### Stage 0 — fixture

Record a real two-client `.vpk` on the LAN. Verifies both clients are
present via `--opcode-stats`. Lands in `tests/replay/multibox-2c.*`.

### Stage 1 — session detection (observation only)

- Add `BoxRegistry`: keyed by creation-time 5-tuple
  (`client_ip`, `client_world_port`, `server_world_port`), with a
  parallel `client_ip → box_id` index for steady-state zone-stream
  routing. Updated by `EQPacket::dispatchPacket` on every world-port
  packet and on each new client-IP/zone-port pairing.
- Replace single-shot `m_detectingClient` lock with continuous
  observation. The daemon still routes only the "primary" box's
  packets into the existing decode pipeline; primary is the first IP
  observed, identical to today.
- New flag `--list-boxes` (paired with `--no-listen`) dumps the
  registry every N seconds.
- Stderr log line on first sighting of each new box.
- No proto/web changes yet.

### Stage 2 — per-box packet streams

- Move the 4 `EQPacketStream`s into a `Box` struct.
- `EQPacket` owns `unordered_map<in_addr_t, Box>`; lazy-create on
  first world-port packet.
- Decode pipeline (state managers) still receives signals from one
  active box, selected at startup via `--ip` or "first seen".
- BPF filter: drop the per-IP host clause when in multibox mode and
  filter to "any EQ port"; client IP filtering moves into per-packet
  routing.
- Smoke test: replay a single-client fixture, golden unchanged.
- Smoke test: replay multibox fixture, verify both boxes register but
  only one decodes (active = first-seen).

### Stage 3 — per-box state managers

- `Box` owns `SpawnShell`, `Player`, `ZoneMgr`, `MessageShell`,
  `SpellShell`, `GroupMgr`, `CombatRouter`, `SpawnMonitor`.
- Daemon owns `unordered_map<in_addr_t, unique_ptr<Box>>`.
- `SessionAdapter` binds to the *active* box's signals; switching the
  active box reconnects the signal graph.
- `daemonapp.cpp` ctor moves the construction loop into
  `Box::Box(deps)`.
- New internal API `Box& Daemon::activeBox()`.

### Stage 4 — proto + web surface

- `proto/seq/v1/events.proto`: add `BoxMeta { string box_id; string
  client_ip; string player_name; string zone; }` and
  `BoxListUpdated { repeated BoxMeta boxes; string active_box_id; }`.
  Bump submodule SHA after.
- `proto/seq/v1/client.proto`: add `SetActiveBox { string box_id; }`.
- `SessionAdapter` emits `BoxListUpdated` on box add/remove/active
  change; handles incoming `SetActiveBox` by rebinding.
- `showeq-web`: dropdown in the header; emits `SetActiveBox`. Snapshot
  flushed and refetched on switch (server re-emits as if
  `Subscribe.replay_since` were unset).

### Stage 5 — capture/replay multi-box

- `VPacket` fixture format already preserves IP/port. Verify replay
  reconstructs the box map without source changes; add a
  `tests/replay/multibox-2c.pbstream` tier-2 golden capturing both
  boxes' active-decode emissions in sequence.
- Add `--box <ip>` replay flag to pick active box for golden recording.

## Out of scope (v1)

- Multi-active (parallel decode → parallel emits). v2.
- Cross-box correlation (group of N boxes that share a leader).
- Per-box prefs / filters.
- Per-box itemcache namespacing.
