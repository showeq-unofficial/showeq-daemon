// BoxRegistry observes every EQ client (a "box") visible on the wire.
//
// Stage 1: pure observation by L4 5-tuple.
// Stage 2: each non-primary Box owns its own world-stream pair so the
//          daemon can run a NamePromoter on each box's OP_EnterWorld
//          (world C>S, char name at offset 0). The primary box keeps
//          using the existing global stream pointers in EQPacket so
//          state-manager wiring is untouched. Zone-stream decoding
//          remains primary-only (Stage 3+ work).
//
// Identity is two-layer:
//   - wire routing key  (always)          : (client_ip,
//                                             client_world_port,
//                                             server_world_port)
//   - stable character id (post EnterWorld): hash of charProfileStruct.name,
//                                             set by NamePromoter. Every zone
//                                             session of one character shares
//                                             it; the Character store owns the
//                                             character->live-session mapping.
