/*
 * seq_globals.cpp — definitions of the cross-cutting globals that the
 * extracted showeq code references via `main.h`.
 *
 * In the legacy showeq/src/main.cpp (a 500+ line QApplication bootstrap
 * that also wired up every Qt widget), these were defined and populated
 * from XML preferences before the main window was built. The daemon
 * doesn't have a main window, so we define them here and let the normal
 * showeq_params defaults apply. A richer bootstrap (loading showeq.xml,
 * command-line overrides, etc.) is a Phase 1 follow-up; nothing on the
 * critical path for getting the daemon to build needs it.
